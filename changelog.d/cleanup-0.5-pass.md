### Changed

- **0.5-boundary cleanup pass.** Closes out the 0.4 series ahead of the 0.5.0
  milestone: the CI test image now installs `r-base` and pandas/matplotlib so
  the R execution-path and dataframe/plot suites actually run in CI (their
  availability guards were permanently false before); the browser graders'
  shared Python snippets, exit-code derivation, MEMFS writer, and package
  preloader moved into one `Public/grading-shared.js` consumed by both the
  grading worker and the main-thread fallback (the fenced-region drift test is
  retired, and the grading worker is now spawned with the page's cache-buster
  so all grading files pin to one release); six APITests suites that spawn
  subprocesses or bind ports gained `.timeLimit` traits; the `alert()` ratchet
  now also covers first-party `Public/*.js`; and the second migration
  consolidation folded the post-#502 incremental migrations into their
  canonical `Create*` files, removing the boot-order hazard class behind
  #1077.

### Removed

- **Pre-0.5 compatibility shims.** The `WORKER_SHARED_SECRET` env alias (a
  deprecation warning had been shipping; use `RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET`), the
  `GET /admin/workers` and `POST /admin/worker-secret` route aliases, the two
  "one-time" legacy boot sweeps that ran on every boot, the decode-and-ignore
  `suiteFiles`/`suiteConfig` fields on `/edit/save`, the verified-dead overlay
  pattern-family editor path, the `NotebookFunctionScanner` memberwise-init
  realignment shim, and the legacy `isOpen` key on course-bundle exports (the
  read-side fallback stays, so old bundles import unchanged).

### Fixed

- **Documentation debt.** `CHANGELOG.md` history through 0.4.669 archived to
  `CHANGELOG-0.4.md`; CLAUDE.md's per-version log compressed into a 0.4
  retrospective; `docs/architecture.md` and `README.md` refreshed to describe
  the five-target + wasm reality, both MCP surfaces, and per-course roles;
  finished-era investigations moved to `docs/archive/`; stale "not yet built"
  headers corrected; and the manual minor-bump procedure is now documented in
  `docs/release-process.md`.
