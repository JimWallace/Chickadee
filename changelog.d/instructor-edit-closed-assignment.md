### Fixed

- **Course staff can edit an assignment's notebooks while it is closed.** The
  notebook editor locked itself read-only ("This assignment is closed — view
  only") for everyone on a closed assignment, including the staff authoring it —
  and an assignment is closed for exactly the window in which it is being
  written, since creating, cloning, or saving one returns it to closed. Staff
  (TA+ or admin in the assignment's course) now keep an editable starter and
  solution notebook regardless of the closed state; students are unaffected, and
  submission stays gated by the closed state for everyone.
