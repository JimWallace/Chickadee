# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project follows Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Swift 6.3 toolchain upgrade**: `Package.swift` tools version bumped to 6.3, CI images updated from `swift:6.0-jammy` to `swift:6.3-jammy`, and Dockerfile build stage updated to match. Runner stderr logging switched from `fputs`/`stderr` to `FileHandle.standardError` to resolve a Swift 6.3 ambiguity; `WorkerCommand.configuration` changed from `static var` to `static let` for strict concurrency compliance. `swift-subprocess` adoption deferred — the Linux fork/exec path requires no changes for the toolchain upgrade.

## [0.4.11] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- **Assignment suite uploads on create/edit**: repeated multipart `suiteFiles` uploads are now collected explicitly instead of relying on single-file decoding. This fixes assignment create and edit flows that were silently keeping only one uploaded test/support file after save-and-validate.

## [0.4.10] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- **Assignment file save/edit round-trips**: browser-mode practice-lab style setups now preserve all test/support files across save-and-edit cycles instead of drifting when `support` rows or legacy `isTest` flags are involved. The suite config backend now treats `tier = support` as the source of truth for non-test files, and compatibility paths still preserve older unchecked rows correctly.
- **Assignment creation file table**: the legacy `Test?` column has been removed from the new-assignment screen. `support` now indicates a non-test file, and any other tier is treated as a test file consistently across the UI and backend.

## [0.4.9] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- **Worker result uploads over real HTTP**: workers now sign and send an explicit `X-Worker-Body-SHA256` header, and the server validates that signed hash instead of re-reading streamed request bodies in HMAC middleware. This fixes the `NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1001` timeout regression introduced by the 0.4.8 worker-auth fix and restores large result uploads during assignment validation and Marmoset import.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- **Worker results auth for streamed bodies**: worker `POST /api/v1/worker/results` requests are now authenticated against the collected request body buffer rather than `request.body.data`, which could be empty for larger real-HTTP uploads. This fixes size-sensitive validation failures where some Marmoset imports passed while others failed with `Invalid worker signature.`

## [0.4.7] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed

- **Notebook edit fallback**: students who open an assignment in notebook view before uploading any work now get a fresh working copy instead of a `404`.
- **Assignment creation without uploaded tests**: instructors can now create assignments with a notebook and solution before adding test cases in the UI.
- **Nested-path notebook and Marmoset imports**: zip extraction now tolerates nested notebook paths more reliably, including Linux-generated archives from Marmoset.
- **Assignment notebook scan CSRF**: scanning a solution notebook for functions on the new/edit assignment pages now submits the required CSRF token instead of failing or hanging in the UI.
- **Linux worker timeout handling**: worker subprocess timeout cleanup was hardened and the worker test suite was restored to required CI coverage with clearer sharding.
- **Browser/WASM runner execution coverage**: the browser runner now has execution-focused CI coverage for manifest loading, dependency skips, timeouts, unsupported scripts, result submission, and notebook extraction.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- **Test coverage expansion**: 107 new tests across 6 test files, bringing the total from 227 to 334.
  - `WebRoutesTests` (18 tests): integration tests for index page, submit form, submission history, results page, and tier visibility.
  - `MarmosetImportParserTests` (28 tests): unit tests for Java properties parsing, test class list parsing, binary title extraction, and manifest conversion.
  - `SubmissionRoutesTests` (14 tests): integration tests for submission create endpoints and download access control.
  - `ManifestValidationTests` (11 tests): cycle detection, unknown dependency refs, self-references, and valid graph shapes.
  - `UWImportantDatesTests` (28 tests): iCal date/summary extraction, escape sequences, relevance filtering, and date arithmetic.
  - `EnrollCSVHelperTests` (16 tests): header detection, quote stripping, encoding fallback, and edge cases.
  - `HTTPSRedirectMiddlewareTests` (10 tests): GET redirect, POST 426, proxy header trust, publicBaseURL override, and host fallback.

### Changed

- **WebRoutes split**: `WebRoutes.swift` (1,200 lines) split into `WebContextTypes.swift`, `WebRoutes+Notebook.swift`, and `WebRoutes+Submission.swift` for maintainability.
- **UW iCal parser refactor**: extracted private actor methods in `UWImportantDatesService` into internal free functions for testability (no behavior change).

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-21

### Security

- **Browser runner enrollment gate**: `GET /api/v1/browser-runner/testsetups/:id/download` and `.../manifest` now verify the caller is enrolled in the course that owns the test setup (or is an instructor/admin). Previously any authenticated user could download test setups from courses they were not enrolled in.
- **Submission error messages**: removed user-supplied `testSetupID` from `400` error responses to avoid echoing untrusted input.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-19

### Security

- **Zip-slip guard**: `extractZipArchive` now validates every entry in an uploaded ZIP against the destination directory before invoking `unzip`. Absolute paths and `..`-traversal entries throw `ZipArchiverError.pathTraversalDetected` rather than relying on OS-level `unzip` behaviour.
- **Security headers**: `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` added to the global middleware stack. Every response now includes `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, and `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.
- **CSRF integration tests**: full CSRF-aware test infrastructure (`TestHelpers.swift`, `CSRFTests.swift`) added; all existing integration tests updated to supply valid session-bound tokens on POST/PUT requests.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- **Test dependency trees**: test suites can declare `dependsOn` — a list of prerequisite script names. If a prerequisite does not pass, all dependent tests are automatically recorded as `fail` with a "Skipped: prerequisite '…' did not pass" message. Applies to both the server-side shell runner and the browser-side Pyodide runner. The manifest is validated for reference integrity and cycles at upload time; entries are topologically sorted before serialization so the runner's linear pass always sees parents before children.
- **Tree UI for assignment files**: the file/test configuration panel on the assignment create and edit pages is now a drag-and-drop dependency tree. Drop a test onto the middle of another root test to make it a child (dependent); drop onto the bottom strip to remove the dependency. Maximum one level of nesting enforced in the UI.
- **Docker Compose deployment**: multi-stage `Dockerfile` compiles both binaries with `--static-swift-stdlib` (no Swift toolchain required on the host); `docker-compose.yml` orchestrates `server`, `runner`, and an optional `nginx` service with named volumes for persistence. `deploy/docker-entrypoint.sh` syncs static assets into the data volume on each startup so template and JupyterLite updates are always picked up on redeploy.
- `deploy/nginx-docker.conf` — Docker-specific nginx config with COOP/COEP headers and a commented-out HTTPS server block ready for certbot.

### Changed

- `TestSuiteEntry` gains `dependsOn: [String]` (default `[]`); existing manifests decode without change (backward-compatible).
- `.env.example` revised: `RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET` documented as required; OIDC vars updated with clearer placeholders.
- `deploy/README.md` restructured: Docker Compose quick-start added at the top; VM/systemd instructions preserved below.
- `README.md` revised: deployment section added, test dependency trees documented, auth description corrected to reflect full SSO implementation.
- `CLAUDE.md` updated: SSO marked complete; Docker deployment marked complete; next-work list updated.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **Course bundle export/import** (closes #68): instructors can export a course as a `.chickadee` zip bundle containing all assignments and test setups, and re-import it on another instance.
- Admin course detail page with bulk CSV enroll, unenroll, and per-student assignment view.
- Admin users table with course filter.
- Archive/unarchive course action with confirmation dialog.
- Assignment count per course displayed in the admin courses table.

### Changed

- Admin courses section reworked: course list and create/edit pages consolidated into a single `admin-course.leaf` template with an `isNew` flag.
- Edit course falls back to existing values when submitted with blank fields.
- Removed dead `GET /assignments/new/details` route (was an immediate redirect; template deleted).
- Removed abandoned `BuildStrategy` / `PythonBuildStrategy` scaffolding (superseded by shell-script runner architecture).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-10

### Changed

- **Breaking (fresh DB required):** Consolidated all patch migrations into their original `Create*` files. Migration count reduced from 11 to 8; no patch migrations remain.
  - `AddUserProfileFields` and `AddUserSSOFields` folded into `CreateUsers`.
  - `AddCourseToAssignments` eliminated; `course_id` column now in `CreateTestSetups` and `CreateAssignments` from the start.
  - `AddCourses` renamed to `CreateCourses`; `AddCourseEnrollments` renamed to `CreateCourseEnrollments`.
- **Schema hardening** (closes #84):
  - `course_id` is now `NOT NULL` with a FK to `courses(id)` on `test_setups` and `assignments`.
  - `course_enrollments.user_id` now has `ON DELETE CASCADE` FK to `users(id)`.
  - `courses(code)` now has a `UNIQUE` constraint.
  - Added four missing indexes: `idx_assignments_course_id`, `idx_test_setups_course_id`, `idx_course_enrollments_course_id`, `idx_course_enrollments_user_id`.
- `APITestSetup.courseID` and `APIAssignment.courseID` are no longer optional; both models require a course.
- `saveNewAssignment` now resolves the instructor's active course and assigns it to newly created test setups and assignments.
- `POST /api/v1/testsetups` now requires a `courseID` field in the multipart form.
- Migration order resequenced to respect FK dependencies (`CreateCourses` before `CreateTestSetups`).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- Baseline database schema now includes canonical fields and foreign key constraints.
- SQLite foreign key enforcement and WAL journaling at startup.
- Performance indexes for high-frequency submission/result/user queries.
- Version scaffold:
  - `VERSION` file.
  - Shared `Core` version constant (`ChickadeeVersion.current`).
  - Runner `--version` support.

### Changed

- Migration chain simplified to canonical create migrations plus index migration.
- API and worker startup now consistently report/consume project version metadata.

### Removed

- Legacy additive migrations that were made obsolete by the canonical baseline schema.
